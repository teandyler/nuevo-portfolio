    "tldr": "I delivered a thoroughly documented React component library that aligns design and engineering and reduces UI inconsistencies in production.",
    "problem": "Even with a strong design system, teams lacked a shared implementation reference. Product Managers transitioned into Product Lead roles and were less familiar with patterns and best practices. Engineers often rebuilt components differently, creating drift between design and shipped UI.",
    "problemImage": "scarecrow-pointing-both-ways.jpg",
    "solution": "I built a Storybook component library that included:\n- Custom React components that are production-ready\n- Easy-to-copy code blocks and import statements\n- Variant documentation and pre-configured options\n- Usage guidelines with clear do's and don'ts for engineers and product partners\nStorybook became the technical source of truth alongside Figma.",

    "impact": "- Reduced design–engineering back-and-forth during implementation\n- Improved reuse of existing components over custom builds\n- Faster onboarding for engineers new to the system\n- Saved prompting credits and reduced time to fully refined prototypes",
    "learnings": "The biggest gains came from documentation, not just components. Clear examples, usage rules, and do/don't guidance reduced misinterpretation and rework.",
