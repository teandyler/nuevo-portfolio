    "tldr": "I delivered a thoroughly documented React component library that aligns design and engineering and reduces UI inconsistencies in production.",
    "problem": "Even with a strong design system in place, teams lacked a shared, authoritative implementation reference. As Product Managers transitioned into Product Lead roles, many were expected to make design decisions without deep familiarity with established patterns or best practices. At the same time, engineers often reimplemented components in slightly different ways, leading to inconsistency, duplicated effort, and growing drift between design intent and shipped UI.",
    "problemImage": "scarecrow-pointing-both-ways.jpg",
    "solution": "I built a Storybook component library that included:\n- Custom React components that are production-ready\n- Easy-to-copy code blocks and import statements\n- Variant documentation and pre-configured options\n- Usage guidelines with clear do's and don'ts for engineers and product partners\nStorybook became the technical source of truth alongside Figma.",

    "impact": "- Reduced design–engineering back-and-forth during implementation\n- Improved reuse of existing components over custom builds\n- Faster onboarding for engineers new to the system\n- Saved prompting credits and reduced time to fully refined prototypes",
    "learnings": "The biggest gains came from documentation, not just components. Clear examples, usage rules, and do/don't guidance reduced misinterpretation and rework.",

    "tldr": "Designed high-fidelity templates that enabled faster, more consistent AI-assisted prototyping by non-designers.",
    "problem": "AI-assisted design tools dramatically increased speed, but that acceleration came with new risks. Without clear structure, outputs often resulted in inconsistent layouts, weak hierarchy, and off-system UI. For non-designers, the tools felt less like a helpful assistant and more like an uncontrolled force—producing more than they could reasonably direct or refine. Like trying to hold a firehose at full pressure, teams were lifted by the speed but struggled to stay grounded in established patterns and best practices.",

    "problem": "Product requirements were often incomplete or inconsistent, and customer signals were scattered across tools and conversations. Important context lived in fragments, making it difficult to form a clear, shared understanding of the problem. The result was weak problem framing and rushed solutioning—teams were left trying to piece together meaning from disconnected inputs, much like a scarecrow pulled apart with its stuffing strewn across the ground, no longer able to hold shape or direction.",

    "solution": "Spec Catalyst is a product discovery and specification platform that turns fragmented customer signals into clear, prioritized initiatives. It provides:\n- A clear **Signal → Opportunity → Initiative** structure\n- Simplified initiative definitions tied to customer pain and business goals\n- Structured inputs designed to flow cleanly into AI-assisted design tools\nLater iterations intentionally supported AI-assisted design and prototyping workflows.",
