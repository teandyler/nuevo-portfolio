CASE STUDY: Design Advocates Program — Elevating UX Craft Across Entrata’s Product Organization

Hero Summary

I created the Design Advocates Program to upskill Product Managers—now Product Leads—in core UX principles, design decision-making, and pattern consistency. By embedding trained designers as advocates, we transformed non-designers into confident, capable creators who produce higher-quality prototypes, align on system patterns, and reduce reliance on designers.

⸻

1. The Problem

⚠️ Product managers were suddenly responsible for design—without design training

As Entrata transitioned to an AI-accelerated product development model (Spec Catalyst + Figma Make + v0), Product Managers were now expected to:
	•	Make design decisions
	•	Choose correct UI patterns
	•	Create high-fidelity prototypes
	•	Understand UX principles
	•	Apply the Entrata design system

But for many, this was their first time owning design responsibilities.
Historically they had relied entirely on designers to make UX, interaction, and visual decisions.

The result:
PMs felt overwhelmed, unsure which patterns to use, and inconsistent in how they applied UX principles—leading to rework, misalignment, and uneven user experiences.

2. My Role

🎯 Founder and Architect of the Design Advocates Program

I created the program from the ground up, including:
	•	Defining the mission and structure
	•	Selecting and training the advocates
	•	Designing the weekly curriculum
	•	Leading critique frameworks and principles discussions
	•	Facilitating alignment on UX patterns
	•	Running a weekly sync with advocates to refine the program

This program became a cornerstone for scaling UX maturity across a hybrid PM/Design organization.

3. The Solution

🧩 A Design Education & Coaching System Built Into the Product Org

The program is built on three pillars:

⸻

A. Design Advocates (Embedded Coaches)

I hand-selected former designers or design-thinking-minded leads to embed within product suites.

Their role:
	•	Serve as UX mentors for product leads
	•	Provide pattern guidance
	•	Conduct design critiques
	•	Help PMs improve prototype quality
	•	Identify systemic design issues
	•	Feed insights back into the Template Library & Component Library

They act as force multipliers, extending design expertise across dozens of product teams.

⸻

B. Weekly Design Align Sessions

Each advocate hosts a standing weekly meeting that includes:

1. Weekly Design Principle Lesson

Topics selected by me and the committee of Advocates. Examples:
	•	Information hierarchy
	•	Interaction patterns
	•	Accessibility best practices
	•	Navigation design
	•	Reducing cognitive load
	•	Consistent component usage
	•	Effective microcopy

These lessons created shared vocabulary and sharpened pattern literacy.

⸻

2. Live Design Critique

Product Leads bring in their current designs or AI-generated prototypes.

Advocates guide:
	•	What’s working / not working
	•	Pattern violations
	•	UX risks
	•	Accessibility concerns
	•	Opportunities to simplify or clarify

This replaced ad-hoc critique with a structured, supportive, repeatable model.

⸻

3. Pattern Alignment Discussion

Teams surface:
	•	Pattern inconsistencies
	•	Missing template types
	•	Needed components
	•	System gaps
	•	Tooling limitations

These insights directly inform:
➡️ Spec Catalyst improvements￼
➡️ Template Library updates￼
➡️ Component Library expansions￼

This feedback loop strengthens the entire ecosystem.

⸻

C. Weekly Advocate Sync

I lead a weekly meeting with all advocates to:
	•	Review coaching challenges
	•	Identify trends across products
	•	Discuss upcoming UX lessons
	•	Align on Entrata-wide design decisions
	•	Update guidelines or standards
	•	Determine future curriculum topics

This kept the program adaptive, scalable, and strategically aligned.

⸻

4. Impact

🎓 1. Elevated UX literacy across Product Leads

PMs gained confidence in:
	•	Choosing correct patterns
	•	Structuring flows
	•	Creating cleaner, more consistent prototypes
	•	Understanding user-centered reasoning
	•	Using the design system as a thinking tool, not just a UI library

Many PMs experienced their first “aha” moments in design craft.

⸻

🎨 2. Significant improvement in prototype quality

Thanks to the combination of:
	•	Templates
	•	Component Library
	•	Weekly critiques
	•	Ongoing coaching

Prototypes became far more:
	•	Consistent
	•	Scalable
	•	Aligned to system patterns
	•	Easy for engineers to evaluate
	•	Easy to convert into production-ready code

⸻

💬 3. Better cross-team alignment & fewer pattern collisions

Teams now share:
	•	A common design language
	•	Agreed-on best practices
	•	A centralized source of truth for patterns
	•	A consistent approach to UX decisions

This reduces UX debt before it ever reaches an engineer.

⸻

🚀 4. Accelerated product development

Because Product Leads are more autonomous in design, this program helps:
	•	Reduce bottlenecks
	•	Speed up initiative throughput
	•	Increase time spent validating solutions
	•	Reduce reliance on scarce designer resources

It directly supported Entrata’s broader efficiency goals.

⸻

🔄 5. Strengthens the larger design ecosystem you built

The program’s insights continually improve:
	•	Spec Catalyst (better prompts and structure)
	•	Template Library (new scaffolding needs)
	•	Component Library (new patterns, clearer rules)

Each system benefits from the others—something hiring managers love to see.

⸻

5. Business Outcomes
	•	PMs produce more consistent designs earlier in the SDLC
	•	Reduction in UX-related rework downstream
	•	Stronger design-engineering collaboration
	•	Higher adoption of design tools and design system assets
	•	More scalable product development with fewer designers
	•	Stronger culture around critique, feedback, and UX excellence

⸻

6. What I Learned / What’s Next

🎓 What I Learned
	•	Design education scales best when embedded into real work—not theoretical training
	•	Critique is one of the fastest ways to improve design skill
	•	PMs become strong designers when given systems, rules, and guardrails
	•	A coaching model (advocates) is more effective than superficial training sessions
	•	UX maturity requires organizational culture, not just tools

⸻

🚀 What’s Next
	•	Expanding the program into a full Product Lead Design Certification
	•	Creating async training paths with Figma Make + v0 examples
	•	Bringing engineers into design critique for even tighter alignment
	•	Adding measurable UX quality metrics tracked via Spec Catalyst
	•	Building automated lessons into AI tooling for real-time guidance
