⭐ CASE STUDY: Spec Catalyst — Transforming Product Discovery at Entrata

Hero Summary

Spec Catalyst is Entrata’s internal AI-powered product management platform that unifies discovery, strategy, and prototyping into a single source of truth—reducing PRD creation from weeks to hours and tripling the throughput of product teams.
I led the design vision, architecture of AI workflows, and system consistency for the second-generation platform.

1. The Challenge

❌ Fragmented, inconsistent, and slow product discovery

Before Spec Catalyst, Entrata’s product discovery process suffered from:
	•	Product managers creating inconsistent PRDs with missing user stories & acceptance criteria.
	•	Designers often stepping in to write PRDs, causing role confusion and project delays.
	•	Engineers writing acceptance criteria, resulting in misalignment and rework.
	•	Slow, inaccurate discovery lacking a structured method to turn feedback into opportunities.
	•	No shared workflow across squads — every team had its own way of documenting strategy.

The result:
Discovery took weeks, clarity was low, and strategic decisions varied dramatically across teams.

2. My Role

🎯 Lead Designer & Vision Owner for the Second Generation

I shaped Spec Catalyst from early concept to a scalable, organization-wide product discovery engine.

My contributions included:
	•	Facilitated early workflow design with the founder (Jeff) and product VPs.
	•	Led UX for the second major version, once active users emerged.
	•	Directed vision and backlog for ongoing evolution of the product.
	•	Set the architectural direction for AI agents and document structure.
	•	Evangelized usage across PMs, designers, and leadership teams.
	•	Partnered closely with engineering to refine outputs for impact.

3. Understanding the Users

👥 From PM + Designer → Product Lead

Spec Catalyst fundamentally reshaped roles inside Entrata.

Primary users:
	•	Product Managers
	•	Product Designers
	•	Combined into a new role: Product Leads

Key Insight

The biggest opportunity was helping product leads turn unstructured signals (feedback, support tickets, interviews, market analysis) into validated, actionable opportunities.

Spec Catalyst’s structured workflow unlocked this for the first time.

4. The Solution

🧠 A Unified, AI-Driven Product Discovery Workflow

Spec Catalyst organizes discovery into a structured flow:

Signals → Opportunities → Initiatives → Specs → Prototypes

I contributed to and QA’d every stage to ensure each generated output:
	•	Highlighted real customer pains
	•	Contained validated user stories
	•	Was ready for AI-driven prototyping
	•	Fit into Entrata’s design system (see Template Library Case Study)
	•	Provided context engineers could rely on

⸻

5. My Key Contributions

A. Opportunity Framing & Clarity

I redesigned the opportunity format to surface:
	•	Core pains
	•	Jobs-to-be-done
	•	Desired outcomes
	•	Evidence & validation
	•	Impact scoring (aligned with company goals)

This drastically improved prioritization and alignment across squads.

⸻

B. Strengthening User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

I created structured patterns that ensured:
	•	User stories were consistent
	•	Acceptance criteria were unambiguous
	•	Specs were ready to hand off without designer or engineer rewrites

⸻

C. AI Architecture & Quality Systems

I was the primary design driver ensuring AI outputs were:
	•	Factually accurate
	•	Actionable
	•	Consistent with company vision
	•	Immediately usable in prototypes

AI Agents support:
	•	Competitive analysis
	•	Pain validation
	•	Opportunity scoring
	•	Market research
	•	Consistent document formatting
	•	Initiative evaluation against company OKRs and product strategy

This positioned Spec Catalyst as an AI-first product discovery engine, not just a documentation tool.

D. Templates for Figma Make & Vercel v0

I created:
	•	The entire template library used to generate prototypes
	•	Structured Markdown → Prompt generation
	•	Mapping of tokens to the Entrata Design System
	•	Consistent UI component libraries for all generated designs

This work ties directly to:
➡️ Case Study: Entrata Template Library￼
➡️ Case Study: Component Library￼

Together, these ensure that every prototype automatically:
	•	Follows Entrata’s design standards
	•	Looks production-ready
	•	Speeds engineering alignment
	•	Reduces design-to-dev context loss by ~90%

6. AI as a Strategic Multiplier

Spec Catalyst uses AI to compress weeks of discovery into hours.

Example AI-powered capabilities:
	•	Summarizing research signals
	•	Converting feedback into structured opportunities
	•	Validating insights against client data
	•	Writing spec documents
	•	Scoring initiatives toward strategic goals
	•	Generating production-aligned prototype prompts

I drove the design and architecture of these systems, ensuring AI was:
	•	Trustworthy
	•	Useful
	•	Auditable
	•	Integrated into the entire discovery lifecycle

7. Collaboration & Cross-Functional Impact

Creating a Single Source of Truth for Product Discovery

With Spec Catalyst, Entrata product teams can now:
	•	Move from idea → validated opportunity → initiative → prototype without switching tools
	•	Speak a shared design + PM language
	•	Reduce spec-writing time from weeks → a few hours
	•	Produce 3× more initiatives with a smaller team
	•	Generate consistent, high-quality specs across product lines

While engineering gains are still developing, we’re now using Spec Catalyst output to shape:
	•	Prototype-to-production pipelines
	•	Code that’s closer to production-ready
	•	Consistent component usage and handoff practices

8. Business Outcomes

📈 Impact on the Organization

Teams fully adopting the workflow experienced:
	•	3× faster initiative creation
	•	Specs written in hours instead of weeks
	•	Higher clarity, fewer alignment meetings
	•	Stronger cross-team consistency
	•	Ability to maintain product velocity despite a reduction in designers and PMs
	•	A mature discovery practice performed by fewer people, enabled by structured workflows + AI

Spec Catalyst became a force multiplier, allowing Entrata to ship more, with less waste, and with higher quality thinking.

9. Connected Programs & Systems (Cross-Case Links)

Spec Catalyst did not stand alone — your leadership connected it into a full product-development ecosystem:
	•	Template Library – ensures prototypes generated from Spec Catalyst match Entrata’s UI system
➡️ Read Case Study → Template Library￼
	•	Component Library (Entrata UI System) – creates consistency between AI-generated prototypes and production code
➡️ Read Case Study → Component Library￼
	•	Design Advocates Program – trains PMs and product leads how to use these tools effectively
➡️ Read Case Study → Design Advocates￼

These sub-systems create a cohesive platform that dramatically improves the product workflow at Entrata.
