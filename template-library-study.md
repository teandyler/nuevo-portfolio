⭐ CASE STUDY: Entrata Template Library — Enabling Non-Designers to Build High-Fidelity Prototypes

Hero Summary

I created Entrata’s Template Library to give non-designers the power to produce consistent, high-quality prototypes using Figma Make and Vercel’s v0—saving an average of 8 hours per project and massively improving design consistency across product teams.

⸻

1. The Problem

⚠️ AI tools made prototyping fast—but not consistent

When Figma Make and v0 launched in May, they unlocked the ability for anyone—especially product managers—to generate UI prototypes using natural language.

But speed created new challenges:
	•	Prototypes lacked structural consistency
	•	Generated UI didn’t follow Entrata design patterns
	•	Non-designers were suddenly expected to think like designers
	•	Component usage varied wildly across teams
	•	Many PMs lost confidence in whether their prototypes were “right”
	•	Rebuilding common layouts repeatedly wasted significant time

The result:
AI-powered prototyping was fast, but it wasn’t yet reliable, and it didn’t scale across a multi-product organization.

2. My Role

🎨 Creator, Architect, and Quality Gatekeeper

I designed and built the entire Template Library to serve as the backbone for Entrata’s AI-driven prototyping ecosystem.

My key responsibilities:
	•	Architected templates that replicate Entrata’s most common application structures
	•	Styled all components to match the design system
	•	Ensured correct interaction patterns and functionality
	•	Built page scaffolding for core product areas
	•	Authored usage guidelines & “prompt shaping” rules
	•	Partnered with Product Leads to shape templates around real workflows
	•	Supported ongoing improvements through user feedback and training

This library became the bridge between raw AI generation and design-system quality.

3. Understanding the Users

👥 Empowering Product Managers Turned Product Leads

With Spec Catalyst redefining PM + Designer roles into “Product Leads,” PMs were now expected to:
	•	Generate UI prototypes
	•	Choose correct components
	•	Make layout decisions
	•	Ensure design consistency

But most had never been trained as designers.

This Template Library solved that gap—making complex design decisions simple, structured, and repeatable.

4. The Solution

🧰 A System of Templates Built on Entrata’s Design DNA

The Template Library includes:

A. Styled Entrata Components
	•	Buttons
	•	Inputs
	•	Navigation
	•	Cards
	•	Modals
	•	Tables
	•	Filters
	•	Form scaffolds

All aligned with Entrata’s custom design system and built using production-minded UX rules.

B. Pre-Built Application Scaffolding

Recreated the foundational structures of Entrata’s application:
	•	Dashboard layouts
	•	Property-level navigation shells
	•	Resident workflows
	•	Leasing & payments flows
	•	Admin settings templates
	•	Multi-step forms
	•	CRUD templates for common entity types

This meant Product Leads never had to start from a blank canvas.

⸻

C. Built-in Best Practices & Interaction Rules

Every template includes embedded guidelines:
	•	Layout conventions
	•	Spacing + hierarchy rules
	•	Standardized copy patterns
	•	Component usage recommendations
	•	Examples of do/don’t patterns

This quietly trained PMs in design best practices as they worked.

⸻

D. Seamless Integration into Spec Catalyst → Prototype Workflow

Templates consumed the structured prompts coming from Spec Catalyst.

This created a pipeline:

Spec Catalyst → Structured Prompt → Template Library → High-Fidelity Prototype

(→ See Spec Catalyst Case Study￼)

Together, they created a powerful ecosystem that:
	•	Ensured consistency
	•	Reduced ambiguity
	•	Cut prototyping time dramatically

5. My Key Contributions

A. Designing the System Architecture

I identified which areas of the Entrata application were used most often and mapped out the template hierarchy.

B. Styling & Component Craftsmanship

I ensured every element aligned with Entrata’s design system tokens, color rules, and spacing patterns.

C. Interaction Logic

I defined the expected behavior for:
	•	Navigation groups
	•	Form validations
	•	CRUD flows
	•	Modals & drawer patterns
	•	Loading & empty states

So prototypes behaved like real Entrata software.

D. User Education & Documentation

I wrote:
	•	A comprehensive Markdown guide
	•	Prompt shaping examples
	•	How-to videos
	•	Internal articles
	•	Office hours support for PMs and Designers

6. Impact

⏱ Saved 8 Hours Per Project on Average

By giving Product Leads ready-made scaffolding and design patterns, prototype creation went from:
	•	10+ hours → 2 hours or less

📐 Massive Increase in Design Consistency

Teams no longer generated screens that looked:
	•	Off-brand
	•	Misaligned
	•	Pattern-inconsistent

Instead, every prototype now feels like part of the Entrata product ecosystem.

🚀 Enabled Entirely New Capabilities

Product Leads who previously avoided UI creation are now producing:
	•	High-fidelity, system-aligned prototypes
	•	With no design background
	•	Without needing to write code

This dramatically increased throughput across the organization.

🧩 A Scalable Foundation for AI-Driven Design

The Template Library forms the core of a system that connects:
	•	Spec Catalyst (input & structure)
	•	Template Library (UI scaffolding)
	•	Entrata Component Library (design system)
	•	Figma Make / v0 (AI generation)
	•	Engineering prototypes (future plans)

This system is now the backbone of Entrata’s AI-first product development workflow.

7. Business Outcomes
	•	Product leads prototype 3–4× faster
	•	UX consistency dramatically increased across teams
	•	Reduced reliance on designers during early discovery
	•	Faster cycles → more initiatives shipped
	•	Lower cost per initiative developed
	•	PMs gained confidence in design decisions
	•	Spec Catalyst adoption increased as prototypes became more reliable

8. What I Learned / What’s Next

🎓 What I Learned
	•	AI needs structure to produce high-quality design; templates provide that structure.
	•	Non-designers thrive when you give them tools built on patterns, not on blank canvases.
	•	A template system becomes far more powerful when tied to a broader ecosystem (discovery → prototyping → engineering).

🚀 What’s Next
	•	Expand templates to handle advanced workflows (end-to-end resident onboarding, accounting, vendor management, etc.)
	•	Create templates for engineering teams to bridge prototype → production
	•	Build adaptive templates that respond dynamically to Spec Catalyst outputs
	•	Turn templates into a “pattern library” that trains PMs through use
